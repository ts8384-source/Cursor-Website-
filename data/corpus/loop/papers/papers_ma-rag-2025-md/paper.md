ABSTRACT
We present MA-RAG, a Multi-Agent framework for Retrieval-Augmented Gener-
ation (RAG) that addresses the inherent ambiguities and reasoning challenges in
complex information-seeking tasks. Unlike conventional RAG methods that rely
on end-to-end fine-tuning or isolated component enhancements, MA-RAG orches-
trates a collaborative set of specialized AI agents: Planner, Step Definer, Extrac-
tor, and QA Agents, each responsible for a distinct stage of the RAG pipeline.
By decomposing tasks into subtasks such as query disambiguation, evidence ex-
traction, and answer synthesis, and enabling agents to communicate intermedi-
ate reasoning via chain-of-thought prompting, MA-RAG progressively refines re-
trieval and synthesis while maintaining modular interpretability. Extensive exper-
iments on multi-hop and ambiguous QA benchmarks, including NQ, HotpotQA,
2WikimQA, and TriviaQA, demonstrate that MA-RAG significantly outperforms
standalone LLMs and existing RAG methods across all model scales. Notably,
even a small LLaMA3-8B model equipped with MA-RAG surpasses larger stan-
dalone LLMs, while larger variants (LLaMA3-70B and GPT-4o-mini) set new
state-of-the-art results on challenging multi-hop datasets. Ablation studies reveal
that both the planner and extractor agents are critical for multi-hop reasoning,
and that high-capacity models are especially important for the QA agent to syn-
thesize answers effectively. Beyond general-domain QA, MA-RAG generalizes
to specialized domains such as medical QA, achieving competitive performance
against domain-specific models without any domain-specific fine-tuning. Our re-
sults highlight the effectiveness of collaborative, modular reasoning in retrieval-
augmented systems: MA-RAG not only improves answer accuracy and robustness
but also provides interpretable intermediate reasoning steps, establishing a new
paradigm for efficient and reliable multi-agent RAG1.

INTRODUCTION
Recent advances in natural language processing have driven the development of Retrieval-
Augmented Generation (RAG) models, which aim to enhance the factual accuracy and contextual
relevance of generated text by integrating external knowledge sources (Lewis et al., 2020; Guu et al.,
2020; Izacard & Grave, 2021; Lin et al., 2024). These systems address core limitations of Large Lan-
guage Models (LLMs), such as outdated knowledge (Zhang et al., 2023b; Kasai et al., 2023) and
poor generalization to domain-specific queries (Siriwardhana et al., 2023; Xiong et al., 2024), by
retrieving top-k documents from an external corpus (Formal et al., 2022; Izacard et al., 2022; Wang
et al., 2022a) to ground the model’s output in relevant evidence.
Prior research in RAG has largely concentrated on optimizing three key components—retrieval,
augmentation, and generation (Gao et al., 2024; Fan et al., 2024) (Figure 1(a)). Retrieval strate-
gies span sparse methods (Jones, 1972; Robertson & Zaragoza, 2009) and dense retrieval (Reimers
& Gurevych, 2019; Karpukhin et al., 2020), each with respective weaknesses such as lexical
gaps (Berger et al., 2000) or retrieval failure on out-of-distribution and multi-hop queries (Dai et al.,

tem performs one-shot retrieval followed by direct answer generation. b) Enhanced systems incor-
porate post-retrieval processing such as document re-ranking or summarization. c) Iterative systems
interleave retrieval and reasoning via query rewriting or multi-step refinement, yet often lack explicit
modularity and planning. d) In contrast, MA-RAG adopts a collaborative multi-agent architecture
where specialized agents handle distinct stages of the RAG pipeline, such as query disambiguation,
targeted evidence extraction, and answer synthesis, using chain-of-thought reasoning. Agents are
invoked dynamically and on demand, enabling fine-grained document analysis and step-by-step res-
olution of ambiguities, resulting in a more robust, interpretable, and efficient retrieval-to-generation
process.
2023). Augmentation methods often rely on post-retrieval processing such as re-ranking or docu-
ment summarization (Chen et al., 2020; Glass et al., 2022; Ma et al., 2024) (Figure 1(b)) to improve
input quality for the LLM, but add latency and may still fail to filter irrelevant or misleading evi-
dence. More sophisticated approaches introduce iterative retrieval or query rewriting (Jiang et al.,
2023b; Asai et al., 2024) (Figure 1(c)), but commonly assume the input query is well-formed and
overlook the broader reasoning process across the pipeline. Across retrieval, augmentation, and
generation, most existing methods treat components in isolation, failing to resolve ambiguities and
reasoning gaps that span multiple stages, such as vague queries, incomplete retrievals, or scattered
evidence, ultimately limiting robustness and transparency in complex QA scenarios.
To address these challenges, we propose MA-RAG, a modular, training-free Multi-Agent frame-
work that performs step-by-step reasoning across the entire RAG pipeline (Figure 1(d)). MA-RAG
views the RAG process as a collaborative effort among specialized agents, each responsible for
a specific subtask such as query disambiguation and task decomposition (Planner), document re-
trieval (Step Definer and Retrieval Tool), evidence extraction (Extractor), and answer synthesis (QA
Agent). Rather than invoking all agents uniformly, MA-RAG adopts an on-demand strategy, calling
only the necessary agents depending on the ambiguity and complexity at each step. Each agent is
guided by chain-of-thought prompting, enabling explicit intermediate reasoning that improves in-
terpretability and task alignment. For instance, agents can decompose an underspecified query into
concrete sub-questions, retrieve documents tailored to each subtask, distill targeted evidence from
multiple sources, and compose coherent answers by integrating dispersed information.
This multi-agent design not only improves robustness to ambiguous and multi-hop questions, but
also provides fine-grained control over the information flow in RAG, all without requiring model
fine-tuning. Empirically, MA-RAG achieves new state-of-the-art performance on multiple open-
domain QA benchmarks, including NQ, HotpotQA, TriviaQA, and 2WikimQA, consistently out-
performing both standalone LLMs and strong RAG baselines across model scales. Ablation studies
further reveal the importance of the modular architecture: the planner agent is essential for multi-hop
reasoning, while the extractor agent significantly improves grounding by filtering irrelevant content.
Moreover, our analysis shows that model size matters most for answer generation, planning and
evidence extraction, while lighter-weight models can be effectively used for retrieval components,

enabling more efficient deployments. These results highlight the effectiveness and flexibility of our
multi-agent framework in tackling complex QA tasks without additional supervision or domain-
specific training.
Our key contributions are as follows:
• We introduce MA-RAG, a modular multi-agent framework that performs reasoning-driven RAG
via structured collaboration between agents, enabling fine-grained handling of ambiguity and
complex queries.
• MA-RAG operates entirely without model fine-tuning, offering a general and adaptable solution
that outperforms or matches strong baselines across multiple QA datasets and LLM backends.
• Through agent-specific chain-of-thought reasoning, MA-RAG provides interpretable interme-
diate steps and demonstrates strong generalization to specialized domains, such as biomedical
QA, without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning.

RELATED WORKS
Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven significant advancements in recent years. Starting
with GPT-1 (Radford et al., 2018) on the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), subsequent
models such as GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), and GPT-4 (OpenAI,
2024) have greatly enhanced capabilities in text understanding and generation. Beyond GPT, mod-
els including Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023a), Gemini (Gemini Team, 2023), and LLaMA ((Touvron
et al., 2023a), Touvron et al. (2023b)) show strong performance across tasks such as question an-
swering and entity recognition (Zhao et al., 2023). LLM training involves unsupervised pre-training,
supervised fine-tuning, and alignment with human feedback, yet domain-specific challenges remain
(Kandpal et al., 2023). Techniques such as PEFT (Houlsby et al., 2019a) improve fine-tuning effi-
ciency, while prompt-based learning (Lester et al., 2021; Li & Liang, 2021), adapters (Houlsby et al.,
2019b; Fu et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022b; He et al., 2022), and reparameterization methods (Hu
et al., 2022; Edalati et al., 2022; Dettmers et al., 2023) selectively adjust parameters for improved
performance. Additionally, recent studies (Wei et al., 2024; Java et al., 2025) highlight the impor-
tance of evaluating factuality and retrieval efficiency in short-form and deep research scenarios.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLM performance by integrating external
knowledge via document retrieval (Lewis et al., 2020; Guu et al., 2020). Challenges remain in
determining what, when, and how to retrieve (Gao et al., 2024). Early methods incorporate retrieval
into next-token prediction (Khandelwal et al., 2020; Ram et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024b) or use end-
to-end pipelines (Guu et al., 2020; Borgeaud et al., 2022; Izacard et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024a),
while others study knowledge representation and retrieval robustness (Xu et al., 2024; Sarthi et al.,
2024). Supervised and contrastive approaches often face scalability and domain transfer limita-
tions (Dai et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023b; Shi et al., 2024). Structured retrieval methods include
HippoRAG (Guti´errez et al., 2024), which leverages knowledge graphs. Recent research focuses on
tighter retrieval-reasoning integration. RA-DIT (Lin et al., 2024) tunes LLMs for context use and
retrievers for relevance independently. Speculative RAG (Wang et al., 2025) drafts answers with a
specialist LM and verifies with a generalist LM. CD-LM (Li et al., 2025b) improves inference via
chunk-level retrieval, while Auto-GDA (Leemann et al., 2025) addresses domain adaptation with
synthetic data. Graph-based methods such as ToG-2 (Ma et al., 2025) and SubgraphRAG (Li et al.,
2025a) utilize subgraph structures to enhance retrieval. Reinforcement learning approaches optimize
retrieval and generation via episodic memory (Shinn et al., 2023), policy optimization (Kulkarni
et al., 2024), evidence citation (Menick et al., 2022), and reflection-based refinement (Asai et al.,
2024; Zhou et al., 2023; Gao et al., 2025). Recent open-source agentic retrieval frameworks, such
as Open Deep Search (Alzubi et al., 2025a), further demonstrate the potential of lightweight reason-
ing agents for democratized, structured search. Compared to prior agent-based RAG systems, our
MA-RAG provides a training-free, efficient, and interpretable solution.
LLM-based Agentic Systems coordinate multiple specialized agents to solve complex tasks
through structured interaction (Guo et al., 2024). Agents operate in diverse environments, including
sandboxed, physical, or abstract settings (Hong et al., 2024; Mao et al., 2025; Park et al., 2023), and
assume predefined, emergent, or data-driven roles (Du et al., 2024; Xiong et al., 2023). Commu-
nication follows cooperative, competitive, or debate-based paradigms through centralized or decen-

Figure 2: Overview of MA-RAG. MA-RAG is a training-free, multi-agent RAG framework that
decomposes complex queries into interpretable steps through collaborative reasoning. The left panel
shows individual components and their I/O interfaces; the right panel illustrates the overall iterative
workflow. A Planner Agent first breaks down the input query into a high-level reasoning plan.
For each step, a Step Definer Agent generates a detailed subquery based on the step goal, original
question, and prior outputs. This subquery is processed by the Retrieval Tool to fetch top-ranked
documents, which are then refined by the Extractor Agent to retain only step-relevant content.
The QA Agent synthesizes the final answer for each step using the filtered evidence and subquery.
MA-RAG iterates through these steps until the full reasoning path is complete.
tralized channels (Liu et al., 2024c; Hong et al., 2024). Capabilities are developed via environmental
feedback, memory retrieval, or self-evolution (Wang et al., 2023; 2024; do Nascimento et al., 2023;
Zhang et al., 2023a; Chen et al., 2024a;b). Recent work has extended agentic designs to RAG. For
example, Agentic RAG for time series (Ravuru et al., 2024) uses hierarchical agent routing, while
CollEX (Schneider et al., 2025) enables multimodal retrieval via vision-language agents. MA-RAG
differs by employing lightweight, specialized agents that collaborate through chain-of-thought rea-
soning, improving transparency and performance in complex QA settings without fine-tuning.

METHOD
In this section, we introduce MA-RAG, our proposed multi-agent framework for retrieval-
augmented generation. We begin by formalizing the RAG problem setting, and then describe our
multi-agent approach designed to improve both retrieval and reasoning.
Preliminaries Retrieval-augmented generation leverages a large corpus of documents or con-
texts—such as Wikipedia—to provide grounded knowledge for question answering. Given a query
q and a corpus C, a dense retriever R retrieves the top-k relevant contexts Cq = {c1, ..., ck}. In
standard RAG pipelines, a large language model (LLM) generates the answer based on a prompt
that includes the query and the retrieved documents:
y = LLM(Promptgen(q, Cq)),
where Promptgen is a prompting template that provides instructions and structures the input for the
LLM. This paradigm allows the LLM to produce answers grounded in retrieved evidence, thereby
reducing hallucinations (Huang et al., 2023).
3.1
MULTI-AGENT SYSTEM FOR RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION (MA-RAG)
While advances in long-context LLMs (Liu et al., 2025) suggest potential to bypass retrieval alto-
gether, practical limitations remain: effective context utilization is still far below advertised limits
(Modarressi et al., 2025), and processing long sequences significantly increases inference cost and
4

latency. More importantly, RAG is not merely a workaround for context size—it is a framework for
extending LLMs’ factual coverage by dynamically incorporating external knowledge. We emphasize
a system-level perspective: RAG should be treated as a pipeline for complex, knowledge-intensive
reasoning, not just improved generation.
Two persistent challenges degrade RAG performance. First, retrieval mismatch arises from semantic
gaps between user queries and corpus content due to ambiguity, domain shift, or granularity differ-
ences. Second, context inefficiency stems from na¨ıvely appending all retrieved passages, which
inflates input length and model attention without guaranteeing relevance (Liu et al., 2024a). More-
over, document chunking introduces trade-offs: larger chunks preserve context but increase noise;
smaller ones lose coherence.
To address these challenges, we propose MA-RAG, a lightweight, training-free multi-agent RAG
framework that decomposes complex queries into structured reasoning steps and coordinates spe-
cialized agents for high-precision retrieval and generation. Figure 2 presents an overview of the
system, which includes four collaborating agents and one retrieval module.
Planner Agent. The Planner analyzes the input query q to perform query disambiguation and task
decomposition. It identifies ambiguities or underspecified elements and reformulates them into
clearer sub-questions if needed. For complex or multi-hop queries, it produces a structured plan
P = {s1, s2, . . . , sn}, where each si denotes a reasoning subtask. The number of reasoning steps
is determined by the Planner, and at each step the system performs a Retrieve →Answer RAG pro-
cess using a sub-query refined by the Step Definer. Breaking down questions into simpler, targeted
sub-queries enables more precise retrieval, and our empirical results across benchmarks validate
this design. The Planner is guided by chain-of-thought prompting with few-shot examples, ensuring
interpretable step-wise decomposition that supports grounded reasoning in downstream modules.
Step Definer Agent. Each abstract step si is made executable by the step definer, which generates
a detailed subquery tailored for retrieval. This agent conditions on the original query q, the plan P,
the current step si, and accumulated history Hi−1 = {(s1, a1), . . . , (si−1, ai−1)}. By grounding
the subquery in context and prior answers, the step definer bridges high-level intent and low-level
execution, enabling precise and relevant document retrieval.
Retrieval Tool. We use a dense retrieval module built on FAISS (Johnson et al., 2021) for fast, scal-
able search over large corpora. Texts are preprocessed into chunks and embedded using a pretrained
encoder. At inference, the subquery is encoded into a vector and matched against the index via
inner product. The top-k relevant passages are returned, enabling dynamic, on-demand knowledge
augmentation at each step.
Extractor Agent. Retrieved passages often contain redundant or irrelevant content. Instead of
appending entire chunks, the Extractor selects and aggregates sentences or spans directly aligned
with the current subquery. This not only filters out noise and mitigates the lost-in-the-middle issue
(Liu et al., 2024a), but also enables effective evidence aggregation by combining complementary
information from multiple sources into a concise evidence set for the QA agent. To avoid context
overflow in multi-hop queries, the Extractor summarizes relevant content at each step, and only the
step-level query with the extracted summary or answer is passed forward. This preserves continu-
ity while keeping context concise and efficient, ultimately supporting more accurate and informed
answer generation.
Question Answering Agent. Given the step-specific query and filtered evidence, the QA agent
synthesizes an answer using in-context learning. It produces a response ai for each step si, which is
passed to the next iteration. Once all steps are completed, the final answer is assembled and returned
to the user.
A key feature of MA-RAG is its dynamic and modular agent invocation. Rather than executing a
fixed pipeline, the system orchestrates agents on demand based on the structure of the reasoning plan.
The Planner Agent is invoked once at the beginning to generate a high-level plan. Subsequently,
for each step si, the system triggers the Step Definer Agent to produce a detailed subquery, which
is then passed to the Retrieval Tool and the Extractor Agent in sequence. The extracted evidence
is sent to the QA Agent, which returns the answer ai. This answer is added to the history Hi, and
the next iteration begins. The system maintains state throughout the reasoning trajectory, allowing
each agent to condition on the evolving context. This modular design enables flexible, step-by-step

EXPERIMENTS
Datasets. We evaluate MA-RAG on two tasks: Open-domain Question Answering and Fact Verifi-
cation. For open-domain QA, we use four widely adopted benchmarks: Natural Questions (NQ)
(Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017), HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), and
2WikimQA (Ho et al., 2020). Among them, NQ and TriviaQA consist primarily of single-hop
questions, while HotpotQA and 2WikimQA require multi-hop reasoning across multiple evidence
sources. For fact verification, we use FEVER (Thorne et al., 2018) as our primary benchmark.
While we include results on TriviaQA and FEVER for completeness, these datasets may be sub-
optimal for evaluating the effectiveness of RAG methods. In particular, GPT-4 can already achieve
strong performance on these benchmarks, 84.8 EM and 87.7 Acc respectively, even without retrieval
augmentation. This is because their questions often do not require external knowledge retrieval,
making them less suitable for assessing the benefits of retrieval-augmented approaches.
Baselines. For question-answering, we consider baseline LLMs without RAG include GPT-3.5-
turbo (OpenAI, 2022), GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2024), Llama3-Instruct 8B (Meta, 2024), and Llama3-
Instruct 70B (Meta, 2024). We also consider baselines in RAG include Atlas (Izacard et al., 2023),
Recomp (Xu et al., 2024), Replug (Shi et al., 2024), Ra-dit (Lin et al., 2024), Self-RAG (Asai et al.,
2024), ChatQA-1.5 (Liu et al., 2024b), RankRAG (Yu et al., 2024)2, Adaptive-RAG (Jeong et al.,
2024), ReAct (Yao et al., 2023), Self-Ask (Press et al., 2023), and Smart-RAG (Gao et al., 2025).
Evaluation Metrics. For Open-domain QA tasks, we use Exact Match (EM) as the main metric for
comparison, while we use Accuracy (Acc) for Fact verification.
Implementation Details. For NQ, HotpotQA, TriviaQA, and FEVER, we use the split from KILT
benchmark (Petroni et al., 2021). We use Wikipedia corpus preprocessed by Karpukhin et al. (2020).
We use gte-multilingual (Zhang et al., 2024b) as our retrieval model. We use different LLMs to build
MA-RAG in different size, from small LLMs with 8B parameters (Meta, 2024) to middle size LLMs
with 70B parameters (Meta, 2024) to black box LLMs (OpenAI, 2024).

RESULTS
Figure 3 provides a visual comparison between MA-RAG and several baseline models across mul-
tiple datasets. The full numerical results with additional discussion are available in the Appendix.
Key observations from our experiments include:
MA-RAG outperforms standalone LLMs without retrieval. Our results show that MA-RAG
significantly enhances the performance of base LLMs when combined with retrieval-augmented
reasoning. For instance, while Llama3-70B and GPT-4 achieve accuracy scores of 42.7 and 40.3
on NQ, respectively, MA-RAG (Llama3-8B) already surpasses these models with a score of 52.5,
and MA-RAG (GPT-4o-mini) achieves an even higher score of 59.5. Similar improvements are ob-
served across other datasets, including HotpotQA and 2WikimQA, where MA-RAG demonstrates a
substantial advantage in handling complex, knowledge-intensive questions. These results underline
that retrieval-augmented reasoning, supported by a multi-agent framework, outperforms standalone
LLMs that rely solely on their internal knowledge base.
MA-RAG outperforms existing RAG models. At the 8B scale, MA-RAG consistently outper-
forms several strong baseline models, such as ChatQA-1.5 8B and RankRAG 8B. Despite using
models of comparable size, MA-RAG (Llama3-8B) achieves superior exact match (EM) scores on
NQ, HotpotQA, and 2WikimQA, showcasing the effectiveness of our multi-agent architecture in op-
timizing retrieval and reasoning. Even when compared to larger retrieval models like RA-DIT 65B
and REPLUG 65B, MA-RAG (8B) demonstrates consistently better performance across all tasks,
indicating that our approach is more effective at leveraging external knowledge while maintaining
efficiency.
When scaling up to larger models, MA-RAG (Llama3-70B and GPT-4o-mini) outperforms the
strongest 70B-scale models, such as ChatQA-1.5 70B and RankRAG 70B, setting new state-of-
the-art results on multiple benchmarks. Notably, MA-RAG achieves a score of 59.5 on NQ, 87.2 on
TriviaQA, 52.1 on HotpotQA, and 47.5 on 2WikimQA. In particular, on more challenging, multi-
hop, and long-tailed datasets like HotpotQA and 2WikimQA, MA-RAG demonstrates significant
gains over previous methods. These improvements suggest that the fine-grained query decomposi-
tion and passage extraction capabilities inherent in MA-RAG are particularly advantageous in han-
dling complex retrieval conditions. A key strength of our modular design is that the number of steps
in MA-RAG is dynamically determined by the planner based on question complexity, with multi-hop
questions resulting in more steps and LLM calls. For example, on HotpotQA, MA-RAG averages
2.3 steps per question, while on NQ, which is mostly single-hop, it averages 1.4 steps. Overall, these
results highlight the critical role of multi-agent coordination in improving open-domain QA perfor-
mance, emphasizing that the integration of specialized agents for different reasoning steps leads to
more effective and efficient utilization of external knowledge sources.
4.2
ABLATION STUDY
Impact of Agents. To understand each agent’s contribution, we conduct an ablation study by re-
moving either the Extractor or Planner from MA-RAG. Table 1 reports performance across five QA
benchmarks. Without the Extractor, retrieved documents are fed directly into the prompt, leading
to consistent performance drops and highlighting its role in refining input and grounding responses.
Removing the Planner reduces MA-RAG to a single-turn RAG system with document filtering but
no query decomposition. While it still performs well on simpler, single-hop datasets, it struggles
with multi-hop questions requiring structured reasoning. The largest performance drop occurs on
multi-hop datasets, emphasizing the Planner’s importance in guiding complex reasoning. These
results show both agents are essential: the Extractor enhances precision, and the Planner enables
effective reasoning across diverse question types.

Impact of LLMs. To assess the effect of model size on different agents in our multi-agent sys-
tem, we conduct an ablation study where each agent is individually replaced with an LLaMA3-8B
model while keeping the others as LLaMA3-70B. This isolates the impact of LLM capacity across
agents on two multi-hop datasets: HotpotQA and 2WikimQA (Table 2). Replacing the QA agent
consistently causes the largest performance drop, especially on 2WikimQA, suggesting that high-
capacity models are crucial for final answer generation. Substituting the Planner or Extractor also
leads to clear declines, with the Extractor highlighting the challenge of identifying relevant evidence
in complex retrieval. The Planner’s ability to generate effective reasoning plans is similarly sensitive
to model capacity. In contrast, reducing the Step Definer has only marginal impact, indicating its
structured role is less dependent on large models.
In summary, for multi-hop QA tasks like HotpotQA and 2WikimQA, it is critical to allocate larger
models to the QA, planner and extractor agents to maintain performance. Smaller models can be
used for step definer with minimal loss, enabling more efficient resource allocation in practice.

Other Domains We further assess the general-
izability of our method by conducting experi-
ments in other domains. Specifically, we eval-
uate MA-RAG on medical benchmark datasets,
including PubmedQA and MedMCQA. We fol-
low the setup in Xiong et al. (2024), using Med-
CPT (Jin et al., 2023) as the retrieval model and
deploying MedCorp (Xiong et al., 2024) as the
corpus.
The experimental results of MA-RAG and the
baselines are shown in Table 3. We compare
MA-RAG with various RAG baseline models,
including Mixtral (Jiang et al., 2024), Llama2-
70B (Touvron et al., 2023b), Meditron-70B
(Chen et al., 2023), PMC-Llama 13B (Wu
et al., 2024), ChatQA-1.5 (Liu et al., 2024b),
RankRAG (Yu et al., 2024), GPT-3.5 (OpenAI,
2022), and GPT-4-0613 (OpenAI, 2024), under
identical settings. MA-RAG demonstrates strong performance in the medical domain, despite not
being fine-tuned on biomedical data. Notably, MA-RAG with Llama3-70B outperforms domain-
specific models such as Meditron 70B and PMC-LLaMA 13B, achieving performance comparable
to GPT-4. When using GPT-4o-mini, MA-RAG surpasses all baselines, including GPT-4-0613 and
RankRAG 70B. These results underscore the generalizability of MA-RAG to specialized domains
through modular reasoning and chain-of-thought coordination, without the need for domain-specific
fine-tuning.
Case Study Table 4 presents a case study from the 2WikimQA dataset. Given a complex query, our
model first generates a plan and solves the problem step by step. Even though each sub-query is
detailed and single-hop, the retrieved documents remain noisy, and the extractor agent selectively
retains only the relevant information. To ensure a fair comparison, we report results generated
exclusively by 70B models. Our main results are based on Llama3-70B, and for reference, we
also include direct answers from Llama3-70B without RAG. Comparisons with RankRAG are not
provided, as it is not open source. Additional examples can be found in the Appendix.

MA-RAG with Internet Access. We further evaluated MA-RAG with web access by integrating
Google Search as the retrieval engine on the SimpleQA benchmark (Wei et al., 2024). Results in
the Appendix show that MA-RAG achieves strong performance (GPT-4o: 40.1% versus MA-RAG
(GPT-4o-mini, web): 86.4%), demonstrating its flexibility and competitive accuracy among recent
web-enabled systems.
Discussions. MA-RAG’s multi-agent design, while improving reasoning and interpretability, in-
troduces additional runtime and token overhead. Each agent invocation involves separate prompts
and responses, which can increase latency and inference cost, especially for complex queries re-
quiring multiple reasoning steps. Although agents are called on demand to reduce unnecessary
computation, the workflow remains more resource-intensive than single-pass or standalone RAG
systems. On single-hop datasets, MA-RAG achieves an average response time of about 2.2 seconds
using GPT-4o-mini, while on multi-hop questions the response time increases to about 4.1 seconds.
We believe this latency remains acceptable for real-world use, especially given the significant per-
formance gains achieved. Our ablation study also shows that not all agents require large models,
suggesting that assigning resource-efficient agents to different subtasks is a promising direction.
5
CONCLUSION
We present MA-RAG, a novel multi-agent framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation that re-
casts the RAG pipeline as a coordinated reasoning process among specialized agents. Each agent,
responsible for planning, retrieval, extraction, or generation, uses chain-of-thought prompting to
enable structured and context-sensitive query resolution. Unlike prior work that tunes individual
9

components or requires supervised training, MA-RAG is entirely training-free and generalizes well
across domains and question types. Empirical results on five open-domain and multi-hop QA bench-
marks show that MA-RAG outperforms strong LLMs and state-of-the-art RAG baselines, achiev-
ing new best results on several datasets. Ablation studies confirm the importance of the planner and
extractor: the former decomposes complex queries, while the latter improves retrieval precision.
Strategic allocation of model capacity across agents yields further gains in both performance and
efficiency. Together, these findings highlight the potential of modular, agent-based reasoning as a
scalable and adaptable approach to improving retrieval-augmented generation.

DETAILS OF EXPERIMENTAL DATASET
A.1.1
MAIN EXPERIMENTS
We evaluate our method on five publicly available QA benchmarks that cover both single-hop and
multi-hop reasoning.
• Natural Questions (NQ) (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) consists of real user queries from
Google Search, where answers are short spans extracted from Wikipedia articles. We use
2837 questions from the development set in the KILT benchmark (Petroni et al., 2021) for
evaluation.
• TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017) includes challenging trivia questions written by trivia enthu-
siasts, paired with independently collected evidence documents. We use 5359 questions
from the development set in the KILT benchmark (Petroni et al., 2021) for evaluation.
• HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018) is a multi-hop QA dataset that requires reasoning over mul-
tiple Wikipedia articles to answer complex questions. We use 5600 questions from the
development set in the KILT benchmark (Petroni et al., 2021) for evaluation.
• 2WikiMultiHopQA (2WikimQA) (Ho et al., 2020) is a multi-hop dataset featuring ques-
tions grounded in two distinct Wikipedia entities, designed to evaluate a model’s ability to
retrieve and reason across multiple sources.
• FEVER (Thorne et al., 2018) is a fact verification benchmark in which models must de-
termine whether a claim is supported, refuted, or unverifiable based on evidence retrieved
from Wikipedia. We use 10444 questions from the development set in the KILT benchmark
(Petroni et al., 2021) for evaluation.
A.1.2
MEDICAL BENCHMARKS
We use two dataset in medical domain to test our method.
• MedMCQA (Pal et al., 2022) is a multiple-choice QA dataset based on Indian medical
entrance exams. We use its 4,183-question development set for evaluation.
• PubmedQA (Jin et al., 2019) is a biomedical QA dataset of 1,000 yes/no/maybe questions
derived from PubMed abstracts.

MA-RAG achieves competitive performance on both TriviaQA and FEVER, with GPT-4o-mini
reaching 87.2 EM and 93.3 accuracy, respectively, on par with or surpassing strong finetuned base-
lines such as RankRAG. Notably, unlike these methods, MA-RAG is fully training-free, relying
solely on agent-based reasoning and chain-of-thought prompting without any gradient-based up-
dates to the underlying LLMs. However, we caution that these benchmarks may not fully reflect the
advantages of retrieval-augmented methods. Strong LLMs like GPT-4 already perform well without
external retrieval (e.g., 84.8 EM on TriviaQA and 87.7 accuracy on FEVER), likely due to the fact
that many questions are either single-hop or already aligned with the model’s pretraining data. We
include these results for completeness but emphasize that more complex, multi-hop datasets provide
a better testbed for evaluating retrieval and reasoning capabilities.
19

A.3
MA-RAG WITH INTERNET ACCESS
To further evaluate the capabilities of MA-RAG in practical information-seeking scenarios, we con-
ducted additional experiments by granting MA-RAG access to real-time web search. Specifically,
we integrated Google Search as the external retrieval engine and evaluated on the SimpleQA bench-
mark (Wei et al., 2024). This dataset is designed to assess factual question-answering abilities of
frontier models without access to the web. It contains questions that often require up-to-date or
obscure knowledge, making it a challenging benchmark for retrieval-augmented systems. We en-
abled MA-RAG to retrieve evidence via Google Search, replacing the retrieval tool with this search
engine.
Results. As shown in Table 6, MA-RAG achieved an accuracy of 86.4% on SimpleQA, demonstrat-
ing a significant improvement over GPT-4o (40.1%) and the GPT-4o-mini baseline when equipped
with web access. While DeepSeek-R1 (82.4%) performs significantly better than GPT-4o alone, our
MA-RAG (GPT-4o-mini, web) results show that multi-agent reasoning substantially boosts perfor-
mance. Although our current results are still below ODS-v2/ODS-v1+DeepSeek-R1* (Alzubi et al.,
2025b), MA-RAG outperforms ODS-v1+Llama3.1-70B (Alzubi et al., 2025b). We believe that the
performance gap largely depends on the reasoning model used. Additionally, we highlight that Per-
plexity Deep Research is a closed-source system without an arXiv paper or public report. These
findings suggest that MA-RAG’s combination of multi-agent reasoning and web integration is also
highly effective for open-domain factual QA.

WORKFLOWS
We implement MA-RAG using LangChain and LangGraph3, where agents communicate through
structured JSON messages. Each agent is represented as a node in the graph, and edges determine
the next agent to execute based on the current state. The overall graph structure representing the
architecture of MA-RAG is shown in Figure 4. For modularity and clarity, we define separate
subgraphs for core components, including the planner, the plan executor, and the RAG pipeline.
A.5.1
AGENT COMMUNICATION
In LangChain’s LangGraph framework, multi-agent workflows are modeled as directed graphs
where each node corresponds to an agent, and edges define the flow of control based on task out-
comes or states. These nodes operate on a shared mutable object called the Graph State, a dictionary
that holds the information exchanged across agents. As agents act on this state, they append or
modify fields to propagate reasoning, inputs, and outputs throughout the pipeline.
In MA-RAG, we define multiple GraphState schemas using Python’s TypedDict to ensure consis-
tency and clarity in communication between agents. Each sub-state corresponds to a key stage in
the pipeline. Below we describe each one individually.

Each agent in MA-RAG reads from and writes to specific fields in these structured states. For
example, the Planner agent sets the plan, the Step Definer appends to step question, the
Extractor populates step notes, and the QA agent writes the step output. This modular
design enables interpretable multi-agent reasoning and seamless communication across the pipeline.

BOARDER IMPACTS
MA-RAG offers a flexible and interpretable framework for retrieval-augmented generation, which
may prove valuable in domains requiring accurate, grounded, and explainable information access.
Its modular design allows for fine-grained reasoning steps and clearer attribution of retrieved con-
tent, which could support applications in fields like education, healthcare, and research. At the same
time, as with any system built on large language models, care must be taken when deploying MA-
RAG in high-stakes environments. Even with structured reasoning, the generated outputs may reflect
limitations of the underlying LLM or retrieved documents, potentially leading to overconfident or
misleading conclusions. As the system enables multi-step reasoning and synthesis, ensuring trans-
parency in intermediate steps and incorporating human oversight remain important considerations
for responsible use.

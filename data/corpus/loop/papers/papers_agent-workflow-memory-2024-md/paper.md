ABSTRACT
Despite the potential of language model-based agents to solve real-world tasks
such as web navigation, current methods still struggle with long-horizon tasks
with complex action trajectories. In contrast, humans can flexibly solve com-
plex tasks by learning reusable task workflows from past experiences and using
them to guide future actions. To build agents that can similarly benefit from this
process, we introduce Agent Workflow Memory (AWM), a method for inducing
commonly reused routines, i.e., workflows, and selectively providing workflows
to the agent to guide subsequent generations. AWM flexibly applies to both of-
fline and online scenarios, where agents induce workflows from training examples
beforehand or from test queries on the fly. We experiment on two major web navi-
gation benchmarks — Mind2Web and WebArena — that collectively cover 1000+
tasks from 200+ domains across travel, shopping, and social media, among others.
AWM substantially improves the baseline results by 24.6% and 51.1% relative
success rate on Mind2Web and WebArena while reducing the number of steps
taken to solve WebArena tasks successfully. Furthermore, online AWM robustly
generalizes in cross-task, website, and domain evaluations, surpassing baselines
from 8.9 to 14.0 absolute points as train-test task distribution gaps widen.

INTRODUCTION
Language model (LM) based agents are rapidly improving, and are now able to tackle digital tasks
such as navigating the web (Zhou et al., 2024; Deng et al., 2023) or operating mobile apps (Rawles
et al., 2023; 2024). Current agents mostly integrate a fixed set of given examples via training (Fu
et al., 2024; Murty et al., 2024) or in-context learning (Zheng et al., 2024). This allows them to
perform well on action sequences similar to those presented in these examples, but results in a lack
of robustness to changes in task contexts or environments (Deng et al., 2023). Essentially, they
fail to grasp the key to disentangling increasingly complex tasks — to extract and learn reusable
task workflows shared across similar tasks and environments (Yu et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024a).
Moreover, as agents solve each task separately, they do not learn from past successes and failures,
and are therefore unable to adapt over time (Yoran et al., 2024).

Figure 1: AWM enables agents to continuously induce and
apply workflows to improve performance, compared to stag-
nant baselines. We show results by AWM on the WebArena
map split as an example.
Motivated by how humans abstract
common task routines from past ex-
periences and apply such knowledge
to guide future activities (Chi et al.,
1981; 2014), we propose agent work-
flow memory (AWM) (§2) to real-
ize a similar mechanism in agents.
AWM induces workflows from agent
trajectories by extracting reusable
routines, and then integrates these
workflows into agent memory to
guide future task-solving processes.
Each workflow represents a goal with
a common routine extracted from
available action trajectories, which
allows it to effectively capture the
most essential and reusable skills agents need to acquire to successfully solve increasingly com-
plex tasks. As an example, Figure 1 shows workflows induced by AWM on the WebArena map

test split of the benchmark (Zhou et al., 2024). AWM starts with a basic set of built-in actions and
solves new tasks in a streaming manner, continuously inducing workflows from the task at hand,
e.g., learning to “find a place by its name” from the first few examples. Moreover, AWM continues
to build more complex workflows on top of new experiences and previously acquired workflows. For
example, the “find a place by its name” workflow, once induced, effectively serves as a subgoal to
build a more complex workflow “get the zip code of a place.” Such continual learning mechanisms
create a snowball effect to induce and apply increasingly complex workflows while expanding the
agent memory, often yielding a substantial performance gap over a vanilla agent that does not adapt.
This gap over the baseline rises as high as 22.5 points on WebArena after rolling over only tens of
examples (as shown by Figure 1).
AWM readily operates in both offline and online scenarios, where annotated examples are either
available or non-existent. When high-quality annotated examples are available for a task, AWM
operating in an offline fashion can extract reusable workflows from these canonical examples and
integrate them into memory to assist test-time inference. Even if no annotated examples exist, AWM
online can also run in an supervision-free setting, where it iteratively induces workflows from self-
generated past predictions that are judged correct by an evaluator module.
We evaluate AWM on two agent web navigation benchmarks (§3): WebArena, which provides rig-
orous execution-based evaluation (Zhou et al., 2024), and Mind2Web, which emphasizes broad tasks
and domain coverage (Deng et al., 2023). On WebArena, AWM improves over the top published au-
tonomous method (Drouin et al., 2024) by 51.1% relative success rate, and even outperforms meth-
ods augmented with human expert written workflows (Sodhi et al., 2023) by 7.9%. On Mind2Web,
AWM effectively improves the cross-task results by 24.6% in relative step-wise success rate.
We further demonstrate the generalizability of AWM on both datasets. On WebArena, we create
a cross-template subset where each example is instantiated from different task templates. AWM
still consistently surpasses all baseline approaches, demonstrating its reliable cross-task workflow
adaptability (§3.1). On Mind2Web, we evaluate AWM on the cross-website and cross-domain test
splits to examine its domain generality, where it scores 8.9–14.0 absolute points higher over baseline,
and the margins become more substantial as the train-test distribution gap widens (§3.2). Both
results show the superior generalization of AWM across tasks, websites, and domains.

AGENT WORKFLOW MEMORY
In this section, we first describe the web navigation task (§2.1), then introduce the workflow repre-
sentation (§2.2), and describe the mechanism of AWM as well as various instantiations (§2.3).
2.1
PROBLEM STATEMENT
For the purpose of this paper, we consider agents with a language model backbone L and text-based
memory M, where the base memory contains documentation of built-in actions such as CLICK
and TYPE.1 To solve a task specified by a natural language (NL) instruction q, the agent acts in an
environment defined by a transition function T. For each time step ti, the environment state si gives
observation oi, which is then passed into the model to generate action ai via L(q, M, oi) →ai.
The action is executed in the environment and changes the state as T(si, ai) →si+1. This observe-
act loop iterates until the model predicts the stop action ai =STOP, or reaches a task termination
condition, e.g., a maximum pre-determined number of steps.
Each completed task forms an experience e, which comprises an NL instruction q and a trajectory of
steps attempting to solve the task, where each step p contains the agent observation o obtained from
the current state, and action taken by the agent a, formulated as p = (o, a). Our goal is to induce
useful workflows W = {w} from the set of experiences E = {e} constructed from past or collected
examples, using an induction module I via I(E) →W. We add induced workflows into the agent
memory M as guidance for subsequent task-solving.
Next, we introduce the workflow representation design, workflow induction method, and agent
memory update with workflows in varied setups.
1Memory is usually implemented as a system prompt or auxiliary information in the main prompt context.

2.2
WORKFLOW REPRESENTATION
Similar to an experience, a workflow comprises two components: first, a textual description of the
workflow d; and second, a series of steps to finish the workflow (p1, p2, ⋯), as shown in Figure 2.

cessful ones, and integrates them into memory.
Workflow Description
To present
workflows in a format where agents
can learn from them properly, it is im-
portant to describe the high-level goal
of the series of actions.
Therefore,
we associate each workflow with an
NL task description d, essentially a
summary of the workflow’s function,
by heuristically extracting from ex-
perience instructions or summarizing
with an LM (see §2.3).
Workflow Trajectory
The work-
flow trajectory contains a series of
steps (p1, p2, ⋯) to finish the pro-
cess described in d. Each p consists
of three parts, demonstrated in pn in
Figure 2, Step 3. (1) A description of the current environment state in NL, such as “Order {id} is
shown”; (2) The reasoning process elaborated by the agent to decide which action to generate based
on observations, such as “Order {id} is found, I will now terminate the task.”; and (3) an action
represented as an executable program over the environment, i.e., stop() that realizes termination.
2.3
INDUCING AND USING WORKFLOWS
At the core of AWM is an induction module I that induces a set of workflows W from one or
more past agent experiences E = {ei}m
i=1. Each experience e = (q, P e) contains an NL task in-
struction q and an action trajectory that consists of a sequence of steps (observation and action)
P e = (pe
1, ..., pe
n) that were taken to solve q. The workflow induction module operates by taking in
E and producing a set of workflows, as I(E) →W = {w} = {(dj, P d
j )}.
LM-based Workflow Induction
To produce workflows that more accurately capture reusable tra-
jectories across tasks, we propose an LM-based module I that prompts the agent to extract common
sub-routines from one or more input experiences.
Different from task instructions that specify concrete, less-repetitive tasks, e.g., “Buy dry cat food
on Amazon and deliver to my address”, we deliberately prompt models to induce workflows at finer
granularities, i.e., a sub-task “search for a product on Amazon” that frequently re-appears as part of
multiple similar instructions. Meanwhile, instead of giving example-specific values (e.g., “dry cat
food”), we enhance workflow generality by abstracting out example-specific contexts, i.e., replacing
“dry cat food” with a more general name “{product-name}” by specifying this in the workflow
induction prompts. These workflows are segmented (based on double-line breaks in the model
output) and stored separately in the workflow memory. See §A for the model prompts, example
workflows, and an examination of quality.2

After the workflows W are induced, they are then inte-
grated into the agent as auxiliary memory, M + W →
Mw, where M stands for the original agent memory,
and Mw stands for the agent memory augmented with
induced workflows.
When solving a given instruc-
tion q, the agent now produces a series of actions by
L(q, Mw, o) = L(q, M + W, o) →a. In the follow-
ing, we introduce AWM in use in two scenarios:
2We also explore a rule-based workflow induction method. See §B for more detailed experiments.

Offline Scenario
AWM can operate in an offline scenario when additional canonical experiences
are available, such as data annotated by humans or synthesized by models. In this case, we perform
workflow induction and utilization in two standalone processes. As seen in Figure 3, AWM first
takes in all training examples from a website by concatenating them into a single prompt, and feeds
them to the LM to create a set of workflows at ‘training’ time; I(Etrain) →Woffline. Second, AWM
incorporates all induced workflows into the agent memory at inference time to solve test instructions
L(q, M +Woffline, otest
i
) →atest
i
. Since the workflows are fully induced before test-time inference,
the agent uses the same workflow memory Woffline to solve each test.
Online Scenario
Extra canonical experiences are not always available or easy to collect, especially
those that cover the same domains and tasks as the test instructions. AWM also works in an online,
supervision-free setting, where only test queries are needed. Agents with AWMonline process test
queries in a streaming fashion, where the agents conduct the loop of induce, integrate, and utilize
workflows after running inference for each test task.

Concretely, the agent starts with the default memory
M; given the t-th test instruction qt passed into the
agent, the agent attempts to solve the task by gen-
erating an action trajectory (pt
1, pt
2, ⋯), which col-
lectively forms an experience et = (qt, {pt}). We
adopt the LM-based evaluation model of Pan et al.
(2024) to output a binary label, Leval(et) ∈{0, 1},
that judges if et successfully solves qt by prompting
a neural model. If et is predicted as success, i.e., 1,
we then transform it into workflow(s) I(et) →{wt}
and add {wt} into the agent memory M t + {wt} →M t+1, which serves as the agent memory to
process the t + 1-th instruction. As depicted in Figure 4, we continue this memory-updating process
by iteratively predicting actions for and inducing workflows from streamed test instructions, until
all tests are processed. We evaluate the success rate of the predicted action trajectories {pt} for all
tests and report the average score.

EXPERIMENTS
In this section, we experiment on two major web navigation benchmarks – WebArena (§3.1) and
Mind2Web (§3.2). For each benchmark, we first introduce the benchmark and top-performing base-
line methods, then present our AWM approach and showcase its ability to achieve superior task
success and generalization across varied setups.
For both benchmarks, we conduct AWM on a website basis. In other words, we group examples by
their associated websites, and respectively run AWM on each group. This mechanism maintains an
small collection of workflows that are nonetheless relevent to the test tasks.
3.1
WEBARENA
WebArena (Zhou et al., 2024) provides 812 web navigation tasks on five websites that cover four
common application domains: e-commerce, social forum discussions, collaborative software devel-
opment, and content management. Most importantly, WebArena supports rigorous evaluation on the
functional correctness of agent trajectories.
We adopt the current state-of-the-art method without human-annotated site-specific knowledge,
BrowserGym (Drouin et al., 2024), which altered the agent default action space. We adopt the
BrowserGym framework and its default action space, and represent webpages using accessibility
trees, following the environment representation in Zhou et al. (2024). Because BrowserGym in-
puts both webpage HTML and accessibility tree representations, to keep a fair comparison with our
method, we also run the BrowserGym version with only accessibility tree webpage representations,
denoted as BrowserGymax−tree. We also compare to the SteP method (Sodhi et al., 2023), which
uses 14 human expert written workflows tailored to solving WebArena. Our method, in contrast,
uses no human supervision and is not tailored to the WebArena setting.

Following baseline approaches, we use GPT-4 (gpt-4-0613) with a temperature of 0.0 to ensure
mostly stable model outputs. Because WebArena only has test examples and no additional high-
quality, domain-aligned examples exist, we only conduct AWM in the online setting as in §2.3.
3.1.1
MAIN RESULTS
As shown in Table 1, our AWM achieves the best published results on WebArena, surpassing the
BrowserGym baseline by 12.0 absolute points and 51.1% relative increase in overall success rate.
Notably, AWM also outperforms SteP, which uses strong domain-specific supervision from human-
written workflows, by a 7.6% relative increase in overall success rate. According to the breakdown
on five websites, our AWM method substantially enhances the agent performance across all websites
over the BrowserGym baseline, by 11.8–30.7 absolute points, indicating its general applicability
across varied domains and tasks.
Beyond task success, we also evaluate the average number of steps the agent takes to solve a task,
as shown in the rightmost column in Table 1. AWM conducts about 2.0 fewer steps per example
than the BrowserGym baseline. Further compared to the Autoeval (Pan et al., 2024) method, which
necessitates additional evaluation and refinement steps to solve tasks correctly, our AWM approach
uses 40.8 fewer steps on average. Both comparisons show that AWM obtains high success rates
while maintaining efficient trajectories.

Figure 5: AWM enables rapid learning from a
small amount of data, i.e., about 40 queries, us-
ing WebArena map test split as an example.
To demonstrate the behavior of the AWMonline
method, we illustrate the cumulative success
rate over the process of online evaluation, by
evaluating the average success rate of the first k
finished examples.
As in Figure 5, the agent exhibits a fast learn-
ing curve in the beginning (between 0–40 ex-
amples), by acquiring the most essential work-
flows, which results in higher success rates. Af-
terward, agents learn more advanced workflows
(Figure 1), while success rates gradually stabi-
lize to the highest point in the early learning
phase. This showcases AWM’s efficient learn-
ing process, which substantially improves per-
formance with merely tens of examples.
3.1.3
CROSS-TEMPLATE WORKFLOW GENERALIZATION
Some tasks in the WebArena benchmark have highly overlapping canonical trajectories, due to the
benchmark construction process that instantiates multiple examples from a single underlying task
template. AWM intuitively improves in-template success rate, that is, given one workflow induced
from a successful example, it would be theoretically easier to solve all other examples generated
from the same task template.

To confirm that the benefits of AWM are not just from learning workflows that help only within
a template, and investigate whether AWM can obtain cross-template (≈cross-task) generalization,
we extract a subset of WebArena examples sourcing from non-overlapping templates, by grouping
examples by their templates and randomly choosing one example from each template group. We run
AWM on this cross-template subset and examine if it achieves similar performance gains.
As shown in Table 2, AWM still achieves the highest performance, overall and on each website split.
These results demonstrate that AWM induced workflows can effectively generalize across different
tasks, i.e., examples instantiated from different task templates.

Building increasingly com-
plex workflows
To more in-
tuitively demonstrate AWM’s
cross-template generalization
and ability to build increas-
ingly complex workflows (as
exemplified in Figure 1), we
conduct a case study to illus-
trate the workflow mechanism
behind it.
As exemplified in Figure 6, the agent creates and learns the “Find a place by its name” workflow
in the early stage of the online process by summarizing past examples. Later, when encountering
an example that further asks to obtain the zip code of the location, AWM agent learns to adopt the
first few steps to find locations by following the existing workflow, and then conducts further steps
to obtain the zip code of the place found. Integrating these new steps upon the vanilla find location
task, the agent successfully builds a more complex workflow, i.e., “get the zip code of a place”.
3.2
MIND2WEB
Mind2Web (Deng et al., 2023) features web navigation in cross-task, website, and domain settings,
stressing the generality of agents on versatile operations and environments. Each task in Mind2Web
has a fixed number of steps; at each step, the agent needs to predict an action, which is evaluated by:
(1) element accuracy: to check if the correct page element is selected, (2) action F1 to check if the
action taken on the element is correct, and aggregating (1) and (2) yields (3) step success rate which
checks that both element and action selection are correct at the current step. Lastly, after completing
every step in the given task, the last metric (4) task-level success rate measures if all intermediate
steps are successfully conducted for this task, i.e., all steps for this task score 1 under metric (3).
Because Mind2Web provides a training set covering part of the tested websites (cross-task split), we
explore both the offline setting that induces workflows from the training set and applies to test sets,
and the online setting, where we stream workflow induction and inference on test queries (§2.3).
Since we focus on LM-based agents that only take textual inputs, we compare AWM to two state-of-
the-art methods, MindAct (Deng et al., 2023) and Synapse (Zheng et al., 2024). MindAct introduces
webpage element filtering and multi-choice task format to ease observation processing, and Synapse
changes the format to a trajectory style and augments retrieved relevant examples. We integrate the
element filtering adopted in both methods, and added workflows instead of retrieved examples in
6

Synapse, to verify the superiority of reusable workflows over concrete examples. To fairly compare
with all baseline methods, we run AWM with both gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4 models with
temperature 0.0. We use the same model for neural workflow induction and agent action generation.

We first run with AWM offline using
both GPT variants, and find that AWM
consistently obtains the highest success
rate in both step and task levels, lead-
ing to 4.0–8.9% relative and 0.4–2.8 ab-
solute points increases in step-wise and
task-wise success rates than the baselines
— Synapse with gpt-3.5-turbo and
MindAct with gpt-4. Decomposing the
step success rate by element and action
selection and accuracy, we notice the in-
creases mainly come from more accurate
element selection, as indicated by the 5.0–
9.0 element accuracy increase in Table 3.
Abstract sub-routines vs. concrete experiences
More specifically, compared to the Synapse
(Zheng et al., 2024) method that retrieves the most relevant training examples, AWM achieves a
+5.0 element accuracy and leads to a +4.0 increase in step success rate. While augmenting concrete,
full examples may bias agents to select elements similar to those presented in the given examples,
AWM introduces less bias on element selection via its abstract representation of example-specific
contexts in workflows, and therefore enables higher step success rates.
Furthermore, AWM integrates frequently-used sub-routines, which can be more flexibly and readily
leveraged across test examples, compared to the full example trajectories used by Synapse, which
are less likely to appear multiple times. In general, our results indicate that the abstract, reusable
nature of workflows contributes to the superiority of the AWM method.
Learn to diverge from workflow guidelines
Despite more accurate element selection, AWM
gets slightly lower action F1 scores than MindAct, possibly because the augmented workflows may
guide the agent to take certain actions aligning to the workflows, which are not always relevant to
the particular environment state at hand. While following the workflows generally results in more
successful task trajectories, agents still encounter some challenges in identifying places to diverge
from the workflow guidelines.
3.2.2
ONLINE AWM ENABLES GENERALIZATION
Beyond the offline induction setting, we further explore the AWM in the online setting, similar to the
WebArena experiment setup in §3.1, where no additional training examples are needed besides test
queries. This naturally facilitates cross-website and cross-domain generalization, which we examine
on the two other splits provided by the Mind2Web dataset: cross-website and cross-domain tests.
In addition to the MindAct baseline, we additionally set bars with our AWMoffline setup, by ran-
domly selecting workflows induced from the training set as memory augmentations. Specifically, for
cross-website examples, we select workflows from the same domain; for the cross-domain setting,
we randomly select workflows from all domains. We conduct AWMonline by iteratively inducing,
integrating, and utilizing workflows over test inferences. We also explore AWMoffline+online in §C.
As shown in Table 4, both AWMonline and AWMoffline surpass the MindAct baseline by a large
margin, resulting in 7.4–8.9, 3.6–3.8, and 14.0–16.9 absolute point improvements in step success
rates, in cross-task, cross-website, and cross-domain scenarios.
In-domain, cross-task scenario
When tested in-domain, AWMonline and AWMoffline perform
comparably to each other. When inspecting the model behaviors in detail, we notice the pros and
cons of each method. AWMonline induces workflows from model-predicted trajectories that are

not always correct, thus can lead to incorrect workflows that degrade model performance. On the
other hand, the training and test examples on some websites vary in task distributions (e.g., training
examples cover how to buy items on Amazon, test examples ask for job applications to Amazon ca-
reers.). AWMonline naturally resolves this train-test gap because its operating process only involves
test queries and environments, therefore yields workflows that are presumably more targeted toward
the test distribution, which in turn, leads to higher success rates overall. Nonetheless, if distribution-
matching, high-quality training examples are available, AWMoffline could bring more benefit by
alleviating the gap issue, as the slightly higher cross-tasks scores of AWMoffline in Table 4.
Extending to unseen websites and domains
When applied on unseen websites or domains,
AWMonline demonstrates greater generalization abilities, compared to AWMoffline. The perfor-
mance margin of AWMonline (over AWMoffline) widens as the domain gaps between training and
testing data widen from different websites (e.g., apple to bestbuy) to different domains (e.g., ma-
cys in shopping domain to reddit in social media domain). Because AWMonline does not require
nor rely on information from the training data, it is not affected by any domain gaps. Nonethe-
less, as demonstrated by the substantial improvements of AWMoffline over the MindAct baseline,
AWMoffline still demonstrates that models can benefit from mechanistically similar workflows from
the previously induced workflow repository.

EXPLORING OPTIMAL WORKFLOW REPRESENTATIONS
In this section, we experiment with other possible alternatives to better represent the workflows.
Specifically, we ablate workflows in sub-routine, abstract formats (§4.1), explore workflows in de-
scriptive texts (§4.2), and lastly, beyond the default workflows that describe environment state in
NL, we compare strengthened observations with website HTML within workflow steps (§4.3).
4.1
HOW MUCH DOES THE SUB-ROUTINE, ABSTRACT FORMAT CONTRIBUTE?
In this section, we compare our abstract, sub-routine-based induction method using LMs to a rule-
based method without context and sub-routine abstraction.
Specifically, our rule-based induction Irule first extracts the action sequence (e.g., CLICK →CLICK
→TYPE) of each experience and deduplicates experiences by their action sequence. In each unique
experience, we then remove the steps whose action cannot be executed on the environment. We take
these unique, validated experiences as workflows. Find more detailed descriptions in §B.

WebArena Results
As shown in Table 5, using rule- and
LM-based workflow induction performs comparably, with a
small 0.1 gap in success rate; the LM-based method appears
more efficient and uses 0.4 fewer steps. Our manual analysis
found workflows produced by the LM-based induction module
Ilm are finer-grained, preventing agents from following unnec-
essary steps that sometimes appear in rule-induced workflows,
hence making the task-solving process slightly more efficient.
Mind2Web Results
As shown in Table 6, compared to AWMrule, AWMlm improves by a 2.8
margin. While augmenting concrete, full examples may bias agents to select elements similar to
those presented in the given examples, AWM lm introduces less bias on element selection via its
abstract representation of example-specific contexts in workflows.

Further, AWM lm uses frequently-used
sub-routines, which can be more flexibly
and readily utilized across test examples,
compared to the full example trajectories
induced by AWM rule, which are less
likely to appear multiple times. In gen-
eral, our results indicate that the abstract,
reusable nature of workflows contributes to the efficacy of AWM lm method.
4.2
WORKFLOWS IN DESCRIPTIVE TEXTS
AWM represents workflow steps in a program format. In this section, we compare with a textual
format for workflows, to understand whether text or code serves as a better format for agent memory.
More concretely, we prompt gpt-3.5-turbo to verbalize the action trajectory in the workflows
induced in earlier experiments. For example, from an action CLICK({submit-id}), its ver-
balized NL representation reads similar to “CLICK the submit button”. We use the same textual
observation and thoughts from code actions as observation and thoughts in these text actions.

From the results in Table 7, AWMtext

in task success rate. Overall, we do not
find substantial performance variance be-
tween workflows represented in text and
code formats, indicating that both forms
can bring effective augmentations to agent memory.
4.3
ENVIRONMENT ABSTRACTION IN WORKFLOWS
AWM describes intermediate webpage states using NL, yet showing concrete states may be helpful
to better ground agents on the environment. Since a webpage’s full HTML can be overly long, we
filter the webpage representation using the relevance predictor of Deng et al. (2023), and augment
each workflow step with this shortened HTML that only has elements predicted as relevant. We run
gpt-3.5-turbo with only descriptions, only HTML, and both types of content.

ferent environment representations.

As shown in Table 8, NL description
of states is more useful than HTML,
as replacing NL with HTML leads to a
slight 0.8 drop in step success rate. In-
terestingly, using both NL and filtered
HTML leads to worse results. We con-
jecture the reason to be two-fold. First,
adding NL and HTML substantially in-
creases the context length, thus making it harder for models to handle things correctly. Second, the
filtered HTML has a substantial number of irrelevant items (missing all correct elements 47% of the
time) thus potentially contradicting NL descriptions and impairing agent abilities.

EXPLORING WORKFLOW UTILIZATION IN CONTEXT AND IN ACTION
Besides integrating workflows as agent memory, we also explore workflows in expanding the agent
action space, denoted as AWMAS. We leverage the programmatic nature of workflows and wrap
each workflow into a high-level function, similar to a shortcut tool the agent can call to perform a
pre-determined series of actions (Wang et al., 2024b). Formally, an agent is initially equipped with
default, primitive actions P (e.g., click, type), and AWMAS adds the induced workflow actions
W (e.g., find place, get place zipcode) to its action space.
The agent can call a primitive or workflow action at each step. When a primitive action is called,
the agent immediately takes that action. When the agent calls a workflow action, it will trigger the

For example, calling the

username)
→
click(box2-id)
→
type(box2-id, password)
→
click(submit-id).
The workflow
action is completed when all intermediate primitive actions are finished.
In Table 9, expanding the agent action space with workflows (AWMAS) slightly improves the
step success rate by 1.3 points, and gets the same overall success rate, 3.2, of the base memory-
augmented AWM. We analyzed agent predictions and found they call workflow actions in merely
18.5% of the tasks, suggesting a resistance of current agents to use newly-added actions. Overall,
expanding actions with workflows seems to reinforce workflows in memory, and brings small extra
gains as auxiliary actions.

While one can in-
duce a book flight work-
flow that enters all required
data via a pre-determined ac-
tion sequence, the action to
choose pop-up airports is executed without seeing the intermediate states with available pop-up
options, and is not flexible enough to do so. More advanced techniques such as granting real-time
state access or dynamic execution loops can be promising to solve this issue, and we encourage
future work to leverage the AWM framework to explore these.

RELATED WORK
Web Agent Benchmarks
The first modern and widely used web agent benchmark is Shi et al.
(2017)’s MiniWob, which evaluates across various scenarios such as flight booking. (Liu et al.,
2018) then created MiniWob++ with extra challenges. More recently, WebShop (Yao et al., 2022)
features a simulated e-commerce website and crowd-sourced text instructions. WebArena (Zhou
et al., 2024) integrates four more websites and enables realistic execution-based evaluations, and
VisualWebArena (Koh et al., 2024) extends with tasks that necessitate visual inputs. Mind2Web
(Deng et al., 2023) proposes versatile tasks and stresses agent generalization across websites and
domains. We use WebArena and Mind2Web to evaluate our method’s task success and generality.
Enhancing Agents for Complex Tasks
Many works improve agents by modifying their action
space, such as constraining its action search space (Liu et al., 2018), enabling LM self-feedback to
refine predicted actions (Sun et al., 2023), or incorporating human-designed actions to certain tasks
(Sodhi et al., 2023). Other works explore ways to augment agent memory, such as adding example
demonstrations in context (Haluptzok et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2024; Fu et al., 2024). However,
high-quality examples are not always available or easy to collect. Our AWM can flexibly operate
even when auxiliary examples are non-existent and only test queries are available.
Learning Common Procedures from Experiences
Some works use full examples (Zheng et al.,
2024) as context for an agent, yet they entangle with example-specific contexts and face challenges
in extrapolating to other tasks or domains (Majumder et al., 2023). Many works propose to extract
frequently reused sub-routines from experiences with rule-based (Ellis et al., 2023; Bowers et al.,
10

2023; Grand et al., 2023) or LM-based methods (Cai et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024c;a) methods,
and use them as auxiliary skills to ease future task-solving (Oh et al., 2017; Liang et al., 2023; Yu
et al., 2023; Mao et al., 2023). We explored both rule- and LM-based methods to induce reusable
workflows, and use them flexibly as context guidance that are free of environment grounding issues.
7
CONCLUSION
We propose agent workflow memory that induces, augments, and uses workflows, offline from avail-
able examples or purely online at inference time. We evaluate AWM on WebArena and Mind2Web,
and achieve 24.6% and 51.1% relative increases in task success rate. AWM also demonstrates its
superior generalization abilities across tasks, websites, and domains. We hope AWM sheds insight
on and boosts advances in dynamic memory building and agent adaptations on varied digital tasks.

A
LM-BASED WORKFLOW INDUCTION
As introduced in §2.3, one realization of our workflow induction module is to prompt LMs to gen-
erate abstract, sub-routine workflows from the given examples, i.e., experience. In this section, we
provide the detailed model prompt, exemplar workflows induced by models, and quality examina-
tion on these workflows.
A.1
MODEL PROMPT
We provide the exact prompt inputted to the model for WebArena and Mind2Web experiments be-
low. Experiments on both datasets use the same prompt.
Given a list of web navigation tasks, your task is to extract the common workflows.
Each given task contains a natural language instruction, and a series of actions to solve the task.
You need to find the repetitive subset of actions across multiple tasks, and extract each of them out
as a workflow.
Each workflow should be a commonly reused sub-routine of the tasks. Do not generate similar or
overlapping workflows. Each workflow should have at least two steps. Represent the non-fixed
elements (input text, button strings) with descriptive variable names as shown in the example.
A.2
EXAMPLE WORKFLOWS
We present several exemplar workflows induced on WebArena and Mind2Web, to give a more con-
crete impression of workflows.
WebArena Workflows
We show one example workflow on each website involved in WebArena.

click(’subcategory id’)
## shopping admin: Edit and Save Changes
This workflow is used to edit specific fields and save changes.
To edit a specific field, I need to locate the field and update its value.
clear(’field id’)
fill(’field id’, ’new value’)
Next, I need to save the changes by clicking the ”Save” button.
click(’save button id’)
## reddit: Navigate to a forum section and select a specific forum
To navigate to a specific forum, I need to click on the ”Forums” section.
click(’42’)
Now, I need to click on the specific forum link based on the forum name provided.

## gitlab: Navigation to Repository and Contributors Section
This workflow involves searching for a repository and navigating to its contributors to find detailed
contribution data.
First, search for the specific repository to gather information.
fill(’130’, ’{RepositoryName}’)
press(’130’, ’Enter’)
Navigate to the “Contributors” section to view contribution details.
click(’311’)

## map: Calculate Travel Time and Distance
To calculate travel time and distance between two locations, I will use the directions feature. I
will fill in the respective fields and select the mode of transportation.
fill(’158’, ’FROM LOCATION’)
fill(’163’, ’TO LOCATION’)
select option(’166’, ’MODE OF TRANSPORTATION’)
click(’171’)
I will use these details to provide the user with accurate travel time and distance information.
send msg to user(’The distance between FROM LOCATION and
TO LOCATION is DISTANCE and the estimated travel time is TIME.’)
Mind2Web Workflows
We present one example workflow in each data domain in Mind2Web.
# travel: enter flight locations
Given that you are on the flight booking page, this workflow enters the departure and destination
city/airport for your flight.
[link] From Departure Airport or City Your Origin −> CLICK
[textbox] Origin City or Airport −> TYPE: {your-origin-city}
[link] {best-popup-option} −> CLICK
[link] To Destination Airport or City Your Destination −> CLICK
[textbox] Destination City or Airport −> TYPE: {your-destination-city}
[link] {best-popup-option} −> CLICK
# shopping: search and sort
Given that you are on the Amazon search results page, this workflow searches for a product and
sorts the results.
[textbox] Search Amazon −> TYPE: {search-term}
[button] Go −> CLICK
[span] Sort by: −> CLICK
[option] {sort-option} −> CLICK
# entertainment: search and select
Given that you are on the IMDb homepage, this workflow searches for a term and selects the best
match.
[textbox] Search IMDb −> TYPE: {search-term}
[button] Submit Search −> CLICK
[button] {best-match} −> CLICK
A.3
WORKFLOW QUALITY ANALYSIS
To provide intermediate information beyond the end-to-end task success, we propose several met-
rics to verify the quality of the model-induced workflows. (1) Number of workflows: The number
of workflows augmented to the memory, fewer workflows is better, whereas agents rely on fewer
workflows to achieve satisfactory performance. (2) Coverage: How many steps in the action tra-
jectory are covered by the workflows, higher coverage presumably signals the general applicability
of the concerned workflow. (3) Function overlap: How much functionality overlap exists between
workflows, we measure this by counting the number of overlapping sub-trajectories (≤2 steps) be-
tween each workflow pair for the same website. Less overlap indicates more maximized workflow
management. (4) Utility rate: How often are workflows used by test examples.
We evaluate the workflows on WebArena test examples and Mind2Web cross-task test examples.
We do not evaluate coverage on WebArena since it requires canonical trajectories, yet which are not
available for WebArena. For Mind2Web, we do not evaluate on cross-website and cross-domain test
examples since workflows induced from training examples do not have domain overlapping with
these test examples, thus less applicable to them.
As shown in Table 10, neural-based induction produces 7.3–7.4 workflows per example, which is
efficient and do not add too much content to the memory. On WebArena, the induced workflows are

used by 0.94 of the test examples, indicating its wide applicability among varied tasks. Further, only
0.08 of the steps between workflows overlap, demonstrating the efficiency of workflows in solving
respective tasks. Workflows on Mind2Web, although used similarly frequently as indicated by the
high 0.91 utility rate, have slightly more functional overlap, and only achieve a 0.40 coverage over
test examples. However, as the training examples used to induce workflows have substantial task
distribution variances with the cross-task test examples, this relatively low coverage is reasonable.
B
RULE-BASED WORKFLOW INDUCTION
Beyond LM-based workflow induction, we also explored a rule-based workflow induction method.
Our rule-based workflow induction module consists of two steps: (i) experience deduplication, and
(2) invalid action filtering.
For deduplication, we extract the action sequence of the experience, e.g., extracting CLICK
→CLICK →TYPE from the trajectory CLICK(’12’) →CLICK(’30’) →TYPE(’44’,
"cat"). We group experiences by their action sequence and randomly select n (n = 1 by de-
fault) experiences from each group. Specifically on WebArena, where the task template for each
experience is available. We conduct another round of deduplication by grouping experiences by
their task template, and randomly selecting n (n = 1 by default) experiences from each group. This
process yields diverse experiences from the given set of experiences.
Next, for each unique experience, we remove the invalid steps in its action trajectory. Invalid actions
means actions that cannot be successfully executed on the environment, because the input arguments
do not meet the requirement of the action function. Specifically, we have one rule of determining
invalid actions for CLICK and TYPE, that requires the first argument to be a string-formatted in-
teger (which refers to the id of an element in the environment). We remove CLICK and TYPE
steps if they do not meet this requirement. For example, an experience with trajectory CLICK(12)
→CLICK(’12’) →CLICK(’30’) →TYPE(44, "cat") →TYPE(’44’, "cat") will
yield CLICK(’12’) →CLICK(’30’) →TYPE(’44’, "cat"). We conduct this invalid ac-
tion filtering for each unique experience, and take the resulting experiences as rule-based workflows.
C
INTEGRATING AWM OFFLINE AND ONLINE
We compared AWMoffline and AWMonline in §3.2, that adopts workflows induced separately from
training or on-the-fly during testing, respectively. In this section, we explore an integration of both
sets of workflows, AWMoff +on, that injects relevant training workflows to warm start task-solving,
but also aggregates increasingly more online-induced workflows to better adapt to test distributions.

From Table 11, AWMoff +on scores between AWMoffline and AWMonline across three test splits.
Rather than an additive effect, workflows induced offline and online are not fully compatible with
each other, particularly, the offline workflows seem to impair the generative quality and utility effi-
cacy of online workflows, therefore resulting in medium results overall.

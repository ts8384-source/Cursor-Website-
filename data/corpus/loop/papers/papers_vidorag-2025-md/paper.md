Abstract
Understanding information from visually rich
documents remains a significant challenge for
traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) methods.
Existing benchmarks pre-
dominantly focus on image-based question an-
swering (QA), overlooking the fundamental
challenges of efficient retrieval, comprehen-
sion, and reasoning within dense visual doc-
uments. To bridge this gap, we introduce Vi-
DoSeek, a novel dataset designed to evalu-
ate RAG performance on visually rich docu-
ments requiring complex reasoning.
Based
on it, we identify key limitations in current
RAG approaches: (i) purely visual retrieval
methods struggle to effectively integrate both
textual and visual features, and (ii) previous
approaches often allocate insufficient reason-
ing tokens, limiting their effectiveness. To ad-
dress these challenges, we propose ViDoRAG,
a novel multi-agent RAG framework tailored
for complex reasoning across visual documents.
ViDoRAG employs a Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM)-based hybrid strategy to effectively
handle multi-modal retrieval. To further elicit
the model’s reasoning capabilities, we intro-
duce an iterative agent workflow incorporating
exploration, summarization, and reflection, pro-
viding a framework for investigating test-time
scaling in RAG domains. Extensive experi-
ments on ViDoSeek validate the effectiveness
and generalization of our approach. Notably,
ViDoRAG outperforms existing methods by
over 10% on the competitive ViDoSeek bench-
mark.

Introduction
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances
Large Models (LMs) by enabling them to use ex-
ternal knowledge to solve problems. As the expres-
sion of information becomes increasingly diverse,
we often work with visually rich documents that
contain diagrams, charts, tables, etc. These visual

elements make information easier to understand
and are widely used in education, finance, law, and
other fields. Therefore, researching RAG within
visually rich documents is highly valuable.
In practical applications, RAG systems often
need to retrieve information from a large collection
consisting of hundreds of documents, amounting
to thousands of pages. As shown in Fig. 1, existing
Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks
aren’t designed for such large corpus. The queries
in these benchmarks are typically paired with one
single image(Methani et al., 2020; Masry et al.,
2022; Li et al., 2024; Mathew et al., 2022) or docu-
ment(Ma et al., 2024), which is used for evaluating
Q&A tasks but not suitable for evaluating RAG
systems. The answers to queries in these datasets
may not be unique within the whole corpus.
To address this gap, we introduce ViDoSeek, a
novel dataset designed for visually rich document
retrieval-reason-answer. In ViDoSeek, each query

has a unique answer and specific reference pages.
It covers the diverse content types and multi-hop
reasoning that most VQA datasets include. This
specificity allows us to better evaluate retrieval and
generation performance separately.
Moreover, to enable models to effectively rea-
son over a large corpus, we propose ViDoRAG,
a multi-agent, coarse-to-fine retrieval-augmented
generation framework tailored for visually rich doc-
uments. Our approach is based on two critical ob-
servations: (i) Inefficient and Variable Retrieval
Performance. Traditional OCR-based retrieval
struggles to capture visual information. With the
development of vision-based retrieval, it is easy to
capture visual information(Faysse et al., 2024; Yu
et al., 2024a; Zhai et al., 2023). However, there lack
of an effective method to integrate visual and tex-
tual features, resulting in poor retrieval of relevant
content. (ii) Insufficient Activation of Reasoning
Capabilities during Generation. Previous studies
on inference scaling for RAG focus on expanding
the length of retrieved documents(Jiang et al., 2024;
Shao et al., 2025; Xu et al., 2023). However, due
to the characteristics of VLMs, only emphasizing
on the quantity of knowledge without providing
further reasoning guidance presents certain limi-
tations. There is a need for an effective inference
scale-up method to efficiently utilize specific ac-
tion spaces, such as resizing and filtering, to fully
activate reasoning capabilities.
Building upon these insights, ViDoRAG intro-
duces improvements in both retrieval and genera-
tion. We propose Multi-Modal Hybrid Retrieval,
which combines both visual and textual features
and dynamically adjusts results distribution based
on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) prior. This
approach achieves the optimal retrieval distribution
for each query, enhancing generation efficiency by
reducing unnecessary computations. During gener-
ation, our framework comprises three agents: the
seeker, inspector, and answer agents. The seeker
rapidly scans thumbnails and selects relevant im-
ages with feedback from the inspector. The inspec-
tor reviews, then provides reflection and offers pre-
liminary answers. The answer agent ensures con-
sistency and gives the final answer. This framework
reduces exposure to irrelevant information and en-
sures consistent answers across multiple scales.
Our major contributions are as follows:
• We introduce ViDoSeek, a benchmark specif-
ically designed for visually rich document
retrieval-reason-answer, fully suited for evalu-
ation of RAG within large document corpus.
• We propose ViDoRAG, a novel RAG frame-
work that utilizes a multi-agent, actor-critic
paradigm for iterative reasoning, enhancing
the noise robustness of generation models.
• We introduce a GMM-based multi-modal hy-
brid retrieval strategy to effectively integrate
visual and textual pipelines.
• Extensive experiments demonstrate the effec-
tiveness of our method. ViDoRAG signifi-
cantly outperforms strong baselines, achiev-
ing over 10% improvement, thus establishing
a new state-of-the-art on ViDoSeek.

Related Work
Visual Document Q&A Benchmarks.
Visual
Document Question Answering is focused on an-
swering questions based on the visual content of
documents(Antol et al., 2015; Ye et al., 2024;
Wang et al., 2024). While most existing research
(Methani et al., 2020; Masry et al., 2022; Li et al.,
2024; Mathew et al., 2022) has primarily con-
centrated on question answering from single im-
ages, recent advancements have begun to explore
multi-page document question answering, driven
by the increasing context length of modern mod-
els (Mathew et al., 2021; Ma et al., 2024; Tanaka
et al., 2023). However, prior datasets were not well-
suited for RAG tasks involving large collections
of documents. To fill this gap, we introduce Vi-
DoSeek, the first large-scale document collection
QA dataset, where each query corresponds to a
unique answer across a collection of ∼6k images.
Retrieval-augmented Generation.
With the ad-
vancement of large models, RAG has enhanced the
ability of models to incorporate external knowledge
(Lewis et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2024b; Wu et al.,
2025). In prior research, retrieval often followed
the process of extracting text via OCR technology
(Chen et al., 2024a; Lee et al., 2024; Robertson
et al., 2009). Recently, the growing interest in
multimodal embeddings has greatly improved im-
age retrieval tasks (Faysse et al., 2024; Yu et al.,
2024a). Additionally, there are works that focus on
In-Context Learning in RAG(Agarwal et al., 2025;
Yue et al., 2024; Team et al., 2024; Weijia et al.,
2023). Our work builds upon these developments
by combining multi-modal hybrid retrieval with a

Problem Formulation
Given a query as q, and we have a collection of doc-
uments C = {D1, D2, . . . , DM} which contains
M documents. Each document Dm consists of
N pages, each image representing an individual
page, defined as Dm = {I1, I2, . . . , IN}. The to-
tal number of images included in the collection is
PM
m=1 |Dm|. We aim to retrieve the most relevant
information efficiently and accurately and generate
the final answer a to the query q.

ViDoSeek Dataset
Existing VQA datasets typically consist of queries
paired with a single image or a few images. How-
ever, in practical application scenarios, users of-
ten pose questions based on a large-scale corpus
rather than targeting an individual document or im-
age. To better evaluate RAG systems, we prefer
questions that have unique answers when retriev-
ing from a large corpus. To address this need, we
introduce a novel Visually rich Document dataset
specifically designed for RAG systems, called Vi-
DoSeek. Below we provide the pipeline for con-
structing the dataset(§4.1) and a detailed analysis
of the dataset(§4.2).
4.1
Dataset Construction.
To construct the ViDoSeek dataset, we developed a
four-step pipeline to ensure that the queries meet
our stringent requirements. As illustrated in Figure
2, our dataset comprises two parts: one annotated
from scratch by our AI researchers, and the other
derived from refining queries in the existing open-
source dataset SlideVQA (Tanaka et al., 2023). For
the open-source dataset, we initiate the query re-
finement starting from the third step of our pipeline.
For the dataset we build from scratch, we follow the
entire pipeline beginning with document collection.
The following outlines our four-step pipeline:
Step 1. Document Collecting.
As slides are a
widely used medium for information transmission
today, we selected them as our document source.
We began by collecting English-language slides
containing 25 to 50 pages, covering 12 domains
such as economics, technology, literature, and ge-
ography. And we filtered out 300 slides that si-
multaneously include text, charts, tables, and two-
dimensional layouts which refer to flowcharts, dia-
grams, or any visual elements composed of various
components and are a distinctive feature of slides.
Step 2. Query Creation.
To make the queries
more suitable for RAG over a large-scale collection,
our experts were instructed to construct queries
that are specific to the document. Additionally, we
encouraged constructing queries in various forms
and with different sources and reasoning types to
better reflect real-world scenarios.
Step 3. Quality Review.
In large-scale retrieval
and generation tasks, relying solely on manual an-
notation is challenging due to human brain limita-
tions. To address this, we propose a review module
that automatically identifies problematic queries.
Step 4. Multimodal Refine.
In this final step,
we refine the queries that did not meet our stan-
dards during the quality review. We use carefully
designed VLM-based agents to assist us throughout
the entire dataset construction pipeline.

proximately ∼1.2k questions across a wide ar-
ray of domains, addressing four key content types:
Text, Chart, Table, and Layout. Among these, the
Layout type poses the greatest challenge and rep-
resents the largest portion of the dataset. Addition-
ally, the queries are categorized into two reasoning
types: single-hop and multi-hop. Further details of
the dataset can be found in the Appendix B and C.
Comparative Analysis.
Table 1 highlights the
limitations of existing datasets, which are predom-
inantly tailored for scenarios involving single im-
ages or documents, lacking the capacity to handle
the intricacies of retrieving relevant information
from large collections. ViDoSeek bridges this gap
by offering a dataset that more accurately mirrors
real-world scenarios. This facilitates a more robust
and scalable evaluation of RAG systems.

Method
In this section, drawing from insights and founda-
tional ideas, we present a comprehensive descrip-
tion of our ViDoRAG framework, which integrates
two modules: Multi-Modal Hybrid Retrieval (§5.1)
and Multi-Scale View Generation (§5.2).
5.1
Multi-Modal Hybrid Retrieval
For each query, our approach involves retrieving in-
formation through both textual and visual pipelines,
dynamically determining the optimal value of top-
K using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), and
merging the retrieval results from both pipelines.
Adaptive Recall with Gaussian Mixture Model.
Traditional methods rely on a static hyperparame-
ter, K, to retrieve the top-K images or text chunks
from a corpus. A smaller K might fail to capture
sufficient references needed for accurate responses,
as the most relevant nodes are not always ranked
at the top. Conversely, a larger K can slow down
inference and introduce inaccuracies due to noise.
Additionally, manually tuning K for different sce-
narios is troublesome.
Our objective is to develop a straightforward yet
effective method to automatically determine K for
each modality, without the dependency on a fixed
value. We utilize the similarity S of the embedding
E to quantify the relevance between the query and
the document collection C:
S(q, C) = {si|cos(Eq, Epi), pi ∈C}
(1)
where si represents the cosine similarity between
the query Q and page pi. In the visual pipeline,
a page corresponds to an image, whereas in the
textual pipeline, it corresponds to chunks of OCR
text. We propose that the distribution of S follows
a GMM and we consider they are sampled from a
bimodal distribution P(s) shown in Fig.3:
P(s) = wF · N(s | µF , σ2
F ) + wT · N(s | µT , σ2
T )
(2)
where N represents a Gaussian distribution, with
w, µ, σ2 indicating the weight, mean, and vari-
ance, respectively. The subscripts T and F refer to
the distributions of pages with high and low sim-
ilarity. The distribution with higher similarity is
deemed valuable for generation. The Expectation-
Maximization (EM) algorithm is utilized to esti-
mate the prior probability P(T|s, µT , σ2
T ) for each
modality. The dynamic value of K is defined as:
K = |{pi ∈C | pi ∼N(µT , σ2
T )}|
(3)
Considering that the similarity score distribution
for different queries within a document collection
may not strictly follow a standard distribution, we
establish upper and lower bounds to manage out-
liers. The EM algorithm is employed sparingly,
less than ∼1% of the time. Dynamically adjusting
K enhances generation efficiency compared to a
static setting. Detailed analysis is available in §7.2.

pipelines. In this phase, we integrate them:
Rhybrid = Sort[F(RText, RV isual)]
(4)
where RText and RV isual denote the retrieval re-
sults from the textual and visual pipelines, respec-
tively. The function F(·) signifies a union opera-
tion, and Sort(·) arranges the nodes in their orig-
inal sequence, as continuous pages often exhibit
correlation (Yu et al., 2024b).
The textual and visual retrieval pipelines demon-
strate varying levels of performance for different
features. Without adaptive recall, the combined
retrieval Rhybrid can become excessive. Adaptive
recall ensures that effective retrievals are concise,
while traditional pipelines yield longer recall re-
sults. This strategy optimizes performance relative
to context length, underscoring the value of adap-
tive recall in hybrid retrieval.
5.2
Multi-Agent Generation with Iterative
Reasoning
During the generation, we introduce a multi-agent
framework which consists of three types of agents:
the Seeker Agent, the Inspector Agent, and the An-
swer Agent. As illustrated in Fig. 3, this framework
extracts clues, reflects, and answers in a coarse-to-
fine manner from a multi-scale perspective. More
details are provided in Appendix D.
Seeker Agent: Hunting for relevant images.
The Seeker Agent is responsible for selecting from
a coarse view and extracting global cues based on
the query and reflection from the Inspector Agent.
We have made some improvements to ReAct(Yao
et al., 2022) to facilitate better memory manage-
ment. The action space is defined as the selection
of the images. Initially, the agent will reason only
based on the query Q and select the most relevant
images Is
0 from the candidate images Ic
0, while the
initial memory M0 is empty. In step t, the candi-
date images Ic
t+1 are the complement of previously
selected images Is
t, defined as Ic
t+1 = Ic
t \ Is
t. The
seeker has received the reflection Ft−1 from the
inspector, which includes an evaluation of the se-
lected images and a more detailed description of
the requirements for the images. The Seeker in-
tegrates feedback Ft−1 from the Inspector, which
includes an evaluation of the selected images and a
description of image requirements, to further refine

the selection Is
t and update the memory Mt+1:
Ic
t+1, Mt+1 = Θ(Ic
t, Q, Mt, Ft−1)
(5)
where Mt+1 represents the model’s thought con-
tent in step t under the ReAct paradigm, maintain-
ing a constant context length. The process contin-
ues until the Inspector determines that sufficient
information is available to answer the query, or the
Seeker concludes that no further relevant images
exist among the candidates.
Inspector Agent: Review in detail and Reflect.
In baseline scenarios, increasing the top-K value
improves recall@K, but accuracy initially rises and
then falls. This is attributed to interference from
irrelevant images, referred to as noise, affecting
model generation. To address this, we use Inspec-
tor to perform a more fine-grained inspection of the
images. In each interaction with the Seeker, the In-
spector’s action space includes providing feedback
or drafting a preliminary answer. At step t, the in-
spector reviews images at high resolution, denoted
as Θ(Ic
t ∪Ir
t−1, Q) where Ir
t−1 are images retained
from the previous step and Ic
t are from the Seeker.
If the current information is sufficient to answer
the query, a draft answer ˆ
A is provided, alongside
a reference to the relevant image:
ˆ
A, Iref = Θ(Ic
t ∪Ir
t−1, Q)
(6)
Conversely, if more information is needed, the In-
spector offers feedback Ft to guide the Seeker in
better image selection and identifies images Ir
t to
retain for further review in the next step t + 1:
Ft, Ir
t = Θ(Ic
t ∪Ir
t−1, Q)
(7)
The number of images the Inspector reviews is
typically fewer than the Seeker’s, ensuring robust-
ness in reasoning, particularly for Visual Language
Models with moderate reasoning abilities.
Answer Agent: Synthesize the final answer.
In our framework, the Seeker and Inspector engage
in a continuous interaction, and the answer agent
provides the answer in the final step. To balance
accuracy and efficiency, the Answer Agent verifies
the consistency of the Inspector’s draft answer ˆ
A.
If the reference image matches the Inspector’s in-
put, the draft answer is accepted as the final answer
A = ˆ
A. If the reference image is a subset of the
input image, the answer agent should check for
consistency between the draft answer ˆ
A and the
reference image, then give the final answer A: If
the reference image is a subset of Inspector’s the
input, the Answer Agent ensures consistency be-
tween the draft answer ˆ
A and the reference image
before finalizing the answer A:
A = Θ(Iref, Q, ˆ
A)
(8)
The Answer Agent utilizes the draft answer as prior
knowledge to refine the response from coarse to
fine. The consistency check between the Answer
Agent and Inspector Agent enhances the depth and
comprehensiveness of the final answer.

Experiments
6.1
Experimental Settings
Evaluation Metric
For our end-to-end evalua-
tion, we employed a model-based assessment us-
ing GPT-4o, which involved assigning scores from
1 to 5 by comparing the reference answer with
the final answer. Answers receiving scores of 4
or above were considered correct, and we subse-
quently calculate accuracy as the evaluation metric.
For retrieval evaluation, we use recall as the metric.
Baselines and Oracle.
We selecte Nv-embed-
V2(Lee et al., 2024) and ColQwen2(Faysse et al.,
2024) as the retrievers for the TextRAG and Vi-
sualRAG baselines, respectively. Based on their
original settings, we choose the top-5 recall results
as the generation input, which equals the average
length of dynamic recall results. This ensures a fair
comparison and highlights the advantages of our
method. The Oracle serves as the upper bound per-
formance, where the model responds based on the
golden page without retrieval or other operations.
6.2
Main Results
As shown in Table.
2, we conducted experi-
ments on both closed-source and open-source mod-
els: GPT-4o, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-VL-
7B(Yang et al., 2024)-Instruct, Llama3.2-Vision-
90B-Instruct. Closed-source models generally out-
perform open-source models performance. It is
worth mentioning that the qwen2.5-VL-7B has
shown excellent instruction-following and reason-
ing capabilities within our framework. In contrast,
we found that the llama3.2-VL requires 90B param-
eters to accomplish the same instructions, which
may be related to the model’s pre-training domain.
The results suggest that while API-based models of-
fer strong baseline performance, our method is also

future applications. To further demonstrate the
robustness of the framework, we constructed a
pipeline using data to rewrite queries from Slide-

able for scenarios involving large corpora. The

Retrieval Evaluation
In Table 3, we report the detailed performance
for various retrievers, including OCR-based and
visual-based. Due to the uncertainty of dynamical
retrieval across queries, we use the average length
of results for analysis. Our goal is to incorporate
more relevant information within a shorter context
while minimizing the impact of noise and reduc-
ing computational cost without losing valuable in-
formation. Dynamic retrieval can achieve better
recall performance with a smaller context length,
while hybrid retrieval combines the results of two
pipelines achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Analysis
7.1
Ablations
Table 4 presents the impact of different retrievers
and generation methods on performance. We have
decomposed the dynamic retrieval into two com-
ponents, Dynamic and Hybrid. Naive refers to the
method of direct input, which is most commonly
used as baselines. Dynamic indicates using GMM
to fit the optimal recall distribution based solely on
the visual pipeline. Hybrid refers to merging the vi-
sual and the textual retrieval results directly, which
leads to suboptimal results due to long contexts.
Experiments demonstrate that the effectiveness and
scalability of our improvements on retrieval and
generation modules, as well as their combination,
can comprehensively enhance end-to-end perfor-
mance from various perspectives.

information, whereas employing a larger value can
introduce noise and increase computational over-
head. ViDoRAG dynamically determines the num-
ber of documents to retrieve based on the similarity
distribution between the query and the corpus. This
approach ensures that only the most relevant docu-
ments are retrieved, thereby reducing unnecessary
computations from overly long contexts and ac-
celerating the generation process. As shown in
Table 5, we compare retrieval with and without
GMM based on the Naive method. The experi-
ments indicate that GMM may reduce recall due to
distribution bias. However, because it significantly
shortens the generation context, it effectively im-
proves performance in end-to-end evaluations.
Latency Analysis of the Multi-Agent Generation.
There is an increase in delay due to the iterative
nature of the multi-agent system, as shown in Fig. 5.
Each agent performs specific tasks in a sequential
manner, which adds a small overhead compared to
traditional straightforward RAG. However, despite
the increase in latency, the overall performance
improves due to the higher quality of generated
answers, making the trade-off between latency and
accuracy highly beneficial for complex RAG tasks.

Modalities and Strategies of Generation
As shown in Fig. 6, the vision-based pipeline out-
performs the text-based pipeline across all types,
even for queries related to text content. Generally
speaking, due to models’ inherent characteristics,
the reasoning ability of LLMs is stronger than that
of VLMs. However, the lack of visual information
makes it difficult for models to identify the intrinsic
connections between pieces of information. This
also poses a challenge for the generation of content
based on visually rich documents. While obtaining
visual information, VidoRAG further enhances the
reasoning capabilities of VLMs, striking a balance
between accuracy and computational load.

Performance with Test-time Scaling
Fig. 7 illustrates the number of interaction rounds
between the seeker and inspector within ViDoRAG
based on different models.
Due to the limited
instruction capabilities of some models, we sam-
pled 200 queries for the experiment. Models with
stronger performance require fewer reasoning iter-
ations, while weaker models often need additional
time to process and reach a conclusion. Condition-
ing the model on a few demonstrations of the task
at inference time has been proven to be a computa-
tionally efficient approach to enhance model perfor-
mance(Brown et al., 2020; Min et al., 2021). The
results indicate that predefining tasks and break-
ing down complex tasks into simpler ones is an
effective method for scaling inference.

Conclusion
In this work, we introduced ViDoRAG, a novel
multi-agent RAG framework tailored for visually
rich documents. By proposing a coarse-to-fine rea-
soning process and a multi-modal retrieval strategy,
ViDoRAG significantly outperforms existing meth-
ods, achieving new SOTA on the ViDoSeek bench-
mark. Future work will focus on further optimizing
the framework’s efficiency while maintaining high
accuracy, and exploring its potential in diverse real-
world applications, such as education and finance,
where visually rich document RAG is crucial.
Limitations
In addition to the advanced improvements men-
tioned above, our work has several limitations:
(1) Potential Bias in Query Construction. The
queries in ViDoSeek were constructed by human
experts, which may introduce bias in the types of
questions and the way they are phrased. This could
affect the model’s ability to handle more diverse
and natural language queries from real-world users.
(2) Computational Overhead of ViDoRAG. The
multi-agent framework, while effective in enhanc-
ing reasoning capabilities, introduces additional
computational overhead due to the iterative inter-
actions between the seeker, inspector, and answer
agents. This may limit the scalability of the frame-
work in scenarios with strict latency requirements.
(3) Model Hallucinations. Despite the improve-
ments in retrieval and reasoning, the models used in
ViDoRAG can still generate hallucinated answers
that are not grounded in the retrieved information.
This issue can lead to incorrect or misleading re-
sponses, especially when the model is overconfi-
dent in its generated content.
In summary, while ViDoRAG demonstrates sig-
nificant improvements in visually rich document re-
trieval and reasoning, there are still areas for further
enhancement, particularly in terms of generaliza-
tion to diverse document types, reducing potential
biases in query construction, optimizing the com-
putational efficiency of the multi-agent framework,
and addressing the issue of model hallucinations.
Future work will focus on addressing these limita-
tions to further improve the robustness and applica-
bility of the model.
Ethical Considerations

Additional Experiments Details
Backbones.
To thoroughly validate the effective-
ness of ViDoRAG, we conducted experiments on
various models across various baselines, includ-
ing both closed-source and open-source models:
GPT-4o, Qwen2.5-7B, Llama3.2-3B, Qwen2.5-VL-
7B(Yang et al., 2024), Llama3.2-Vision-90B. For
OCR-based pipelines, we use PPOCR(Ma et al.,
2019) to recognize text within documents. Option-
ally, VLMs can also be employed for text recogni-
tion, as their OCR capabilities are quite strong.
Experimental Environments.
We conducted
our experiments on a server equipped with 8 A100
GPUs and 96 CPU cores. Open-source models
require substantial computational resources.
Retrieval Implementation Details.
Due to the
context length limitations of the model, we use
the Top-2K pages to fit the GMM and we restrict
the output chunks of the GMM algorithm to be
between K/2 and K, we set K = 10 in practice.

rizes queries from a logical reasoning perspective
into single-hop and multi-hop. Non-span, single-

derived from a single information-dense sentence,
reference information that is sparse but located
on the same page, and reference information dis-
tributed across different pages. The statistical in-

The SlideVQA dataset fo-
cuses on evaluating the RAG system’s ability to
understand both visually sparse and visually dense
information. When multi-hop questions involve ref-
erence information spread across different pages,
it presents a significant challenge to the RAG sys-
tem, further demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach.

C
Data Construction Details
To construct the ViDoSeek dataset, we developed a
four-step pipeline to ensure that the queries meet
our requirements.
Step 1.
Document Collecting.
We collected
English-language slides containing 25 to 50 pages,
covering 12 domains such as economics, technol-
ogy, literature, and geography, etc.
Step 2. Query Creation.
To make the queries
more suitable for RAG over a large-scale collec-
tion, our experts constructed queries based on the
following requirements: (i) Each query must have
a unique answer when paired with the document.
(ii) The query must include unique keywords that
point to the specific document and pages. (iii) The
query should require external knowledge. Addi-
tionally, we encouraged constructing queries in
various forms and with different sources and rea-
soning types to better reflect real-world scenarios.
Our queries not only focus on types of references,
including text, tables, charts, and layouts, but also
provide a classification of reasoning types, includ-
ing single-hop and multi-hop.
Step 3. Quality Review.
To effectively evaluate
the generation and retrieval quality of our RAG sys-
tem, we require queries that yield unique answers,
preferably located on a specific page or within a
few pages. However, in large-scale retrieval and
generation tasks, relying solely on manual annota-
tion is challenging due to human cognitive limita-
tions. To address this, we propose a review module
that automatically identifies problematic queries.
This module consists of two steps: (i) We prompt
LLMs to filter out queries that may have multiple
answers across the document collection; for exam-
ple, the question What is the profit for this company
in 2024? might have a unique answer within a sin-
gle document but could yield multiple answers in
a multi-document setting. (ii) For the remaining
queries, we retrieve the top-k slides for each query
and use a VLM to determine whether each slide
can answer the query. If only the golden page can
answer the question, we consider it to meet the
requirements. If pages other than the golden page
can answer the query, we have experts manually
evaluate and refine them.
Step 4. Multimodal Refine.
In this final step,
we refine the queries that did not meet our stan-
dards during the quality review. The goal is to
adjust these queries so they satisfy the following
requirements: (i) The refined query should point
to specific pages within the large collection with
minimal additional information; (ii) The refined
query must retain its original meaning. We use
carefully designed VLM-based agents to assist us
throughout the entire dataset construction pipeline.
The prompt is presented in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10, re-
spectively. We will first perform filtering based on
semantics, and then conduct a fine-grained review
using a multimodal reviewer.

More Details about Multi-Agent
Generation with Iterative Reasoning
We designed prompts to drive VLMs-based agents,
and through our experiments, we found that some
open-source models require the design of few-shot
examples to learn specific thought patterns. See
detailed prompts in Fig. 12, Fig.13 and Fig.14.
